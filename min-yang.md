Here is a table with some collaborators *(tables use `|`s and `-`s to separate columns and rows)*:

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

You can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, with an additional preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.
