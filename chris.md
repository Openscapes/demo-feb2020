# The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

Slides (that I made in R!) for Feb 25, 2020 seminar at UMass Dartmouth SMAST: [R and teamwork for better science in less time](https://openscapes.github.io/slides/betterscience/smast#1).

A list of fun links

> Here is a block quote that sets the text off from the rest of the page. Kind of neat to see how it works. Hard to come up with text off the top of my head to make it look reasonable.

Here is a table with some collaborators *(tables use `|`s and `-`s to separate columns and rows)*:


Name | Twitter | GitHub

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

You can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, with an additional preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.
