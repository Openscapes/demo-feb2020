# The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

Slides (that I made in R!) for Feb 25, 2020 seminar at UMass Dartmouth SMAST: [R and teamwork for better science in less time](https://openscapes.github.io/slides/betterscience/smast#1).

You can contact me *(lists need a carriage return before list items)*:

Here is a table with some collaborators *(tables use `|`s and `-`s to separate columns and rows)*:


Name | Twitter | GitHub

Jamie | [@jafflerbach](https://twitter.com/jafflerbach) | [@jafflerbach](https://github.com/jafflerbach)
Melanie |  | [@Melsteroni](https://github.com/Melsteroni)

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

Link to my [Rpath repository](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/Rpath)

You can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, with an additional preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.
