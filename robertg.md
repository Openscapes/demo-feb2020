# The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

Slides (that I did not make!) for Feb 25, 2020 seminar at UMass Dartmouth SMAST: [R and teamwork for better science in less time](https://openscapes.github.io/slides/betterscience/smast#1).

You can contact me *(lists need a carriage return before list items)*: 

- twitter: Isn't this a chatroom for birds?
- github: [@gambler1650](https://github.com/gambler1650)


Here is a table with some collaborators *(tables use `|`s and `-`s to separate columns and rows)*:


Name | Twitter | GitHub
-----|---------|--------

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

You can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, with an additional preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.
