# The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

Slides (that I made in R!) for Feb 25, 2020 seminar at UMass Dartmouth SMAST: [R and teamwork for better science in less time](https://openscapes.github.io/slides/betterscience/smast#1).

~ this is a tilda
~~ two tildas
* star = acts the same as '-' for bullet points
* start-surrounded text *
^ what does a carat do?
% oooo percentage
---- horizonal lines
\ one slash
/ slash other way
$ dolla dolla bill y'all
'single quote'
"double quote"

Those didn't work and didn't change lines.

Have to use character escapes for \& and \<, but what about > (greater than)

Here is a table with some collaborators *(tables use `|`s and `-`s to separate columns and rows)*:

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

You can include an image with the same `[]()` pattern, with an additional preceding exclamation point: `![]()`. From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url.
